# Specification Quality Checklist: 資料過濾機制 - UserMapping 與 Team Mapping

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Issues Found

✅ No issues found - all validation items passed

## Notes

- Specification is well-structured with clear priorities and acceptance scenarios
- All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved with user input (Option A selected for Work Item filtering behavior)
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Added FR-012 to explicitly define behavior when Work Item is filtered but PR/MR references it
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
